Hi, my name is Lucas Neuhaus, a self-taught software developer from Brazil. In 2018, I obtained my degree in Civil Engineering and I was unhappy until I discovered my genuine passion: Programming. Since then, I have been working in both full-time and freelance positions.

I'm naturally curious, I love learning new technologies and building complex applications. Over the past few years, I have primarily focused on utilizing React, Typescript, and Material UI in my work. This technology stack is one in which I possess a high level of proficiency and confidence.
