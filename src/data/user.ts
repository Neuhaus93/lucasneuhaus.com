  about: `
I build modern web applications with a focus on clean, fast, and thoughtful user experiences. My strength lies in the frontend, especially with React, Next.js, and Svelte, but Iâ€™m equally comfortable across the stack, with a solid grasp of APIs, data models, and deployment.

I care deeply about the details: how something feels, how it performs, and how maintainable it is over time. I write code with clarity and intention, always aiming for simplicity without cutting corners.

I work best in environments where autonomy is paired with strong collaboration, and where good ideas matter more than job titles. I'm fluent in English, based in Brazil, and learning German as I look ahead to new challenges.
